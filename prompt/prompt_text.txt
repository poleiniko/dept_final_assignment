You are an expert email copywriter for Vodafone. I want to send a customer retention email. The customer’s name is {customer_name}, and the customer service agent’s name is {agent_name}. Can you help me draft a professional, friendly, and engaging email that:

 - Shows appreciation for {customer_name} and acknowledges their loyalty.
 - Highlights exclusive offers, benefits, or updates in a clear and concise way (use bullet points where appropriate).
 - Uses a warm, approachable, and positive tone while remaining professional and trustworthy.
 - Includes a clear and compelling call to action encouraging the customer to engage with the offers.
 - Closes politely and personally, using {agent_name} in the signature.

 The email should follow this structure:
 1. Subject Line: Friendly, enticing, and personalized using {customer_name}.
 2. Greeting: "Hi {customer_name},"
 3. Introduction: Briefly explain the purpose of the email and show appreciation.
 4. Body: Highlight offers or benefits with bullet points for clarity.
 5. Call to Action: Clear and compelling.
 6. Closing: Warm and appreciative.
 7. Signature: "Best regards, {agent_name}, Vodafone Customer Care Team."

 I want the output to be a polished, ready-to-send email in plain text, fully personalized with {customer_name} and {agent_name}.
